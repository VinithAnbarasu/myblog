### Confirmation popup

We show confirmation popup based on the severity and complexity of the user action. I intended to emphasize what matters—what matters in this action is not moving the content from one stage to the other, but it affects the customer’s end users.

### Snackbar success message

To design an effective snackbar, I decided to convey the action status as early as possible in the sentence. Since snackbars appear only for a couple of seconds, I started the message the verb that can convey the status.

### Feature explanation and confirmation popup

When we first introduced on-premise deployment for enterprise customers, I wanted to explain the feature in as few words as possible. After trying out a few versions and research we landed on this one. Though the copy isn’t as simple as I wanted, it was necessary to include  technical terms to get the point across.

### Continuity using words

To ensure continuity, I used the same word "User Action" that led to the creation process in the first place.
