### Feature and page description

The descriptions used throughout this page had several inconsistencies and didn't convey the capabilities of the feature. These inconsistencies impacted the feature adoption.

### Confirmation popup

Though I detest confirmation popups I do believe in using them effectively based on severity and complexity of user action. 
In this action, I intend to emphasize on two crucial consequences,
1. The content is moving from one stage to other
2. At the same time, it is impacting the end users

### Snackbar success message

To design an effective snackbar, I decided to convey the action status as early as possible in the sentence. Since snackbars appear only for a couple of seconds, I started the message with the verb that can convey the status.

### Feature explanation and confirmation popup

When we first introduced on-premise deployment for enterprise customers, I wanted to explain the feature in as few words as possible. After trying out a few versions and research we landed on this one. Though the copy isnâ€™t as simple as I wanted, it was necessary to include  technical terms to get the point across.

### Continuity using words

To ensure continuity, I used the same word "User Action" that led to the creation process in the first place.

### Error message

Feedback from customers showed that they were not able to resolve their mistake using the error message. The new error message involved collaborating with the developers and a complete rework.
