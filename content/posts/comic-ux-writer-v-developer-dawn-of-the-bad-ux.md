Building a cohesive user experience means blending responsible words in the app.

When I started my career a few years ago, some developers, even designers, thought of microcopies only as an aesthetic devoid of hard logic. Sometimes the changes I suggested would be forgotten or downright ignored. It was always an uphill battle. 

It was one of those conversations that inspired this comic. 

UX Writers spend days, sometimes weeks, perfecting an error message by planning, researching, and experimenting with microcopies that guide users consciously or otherwise. To ignore UX Writing is to ignore the only human connection in the app â€” language.
