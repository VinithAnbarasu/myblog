We all see a lot of posts about self-discipline. Go to any social media sites like LinkedIn, Twitter, YouTube, etc. and we can see people talking about how they are disciplined more than ever using an XYZ method and how it made them X-times productive.

All these posts put a lot of pressure on us and make us want more discipline. Today, many of our choices are motivated by social comparison. We see something better and instantly believe that we need it. Especially if it can be attained for free.

I've been down this road many times. I'd see productivity or daily routine video and instantly go like, "If all it needs is our hard work then I can do it. I can be as productive as them". (Eye of Tiger playing in the background).

But had it involved any money, I'd have paused, taken a step back and thought if I really needed it. Well, we are only humans.

# Want is different from Need

Productivity apps on the market are not helping either. Most apps offer a free plan and I believed that if I start using the app and stick to the schedule then I'll be productive. 

NAIVE AND DUMB!

Most productivity apps that I've used, try to police my day and the way I work. For example, task duration, ETA, etc. But soon I realized that policing yourself every minute of the day is exhausting and it will fail.

I should've accepted that I cannot force myself to be productive. But I blamed the app. Classic but a coward move. Over the past 3 years, I've used at least 15 different productivity apps and every time I failed the blame game continued. I believed I was failed by external forces so I overlooked my internal failure. 

# An epiphany

Finally, I realized that it is not the apps that were screwed but me. An epiphany, if you may. 

I realized that I don't need more self-discipline. I have all the self-discipline I need. I just wasn't using it effectively. I was focused on the app instead of the process of being productive. Apps exist purely to supplement that, not to somehow make me more productive. If I don't want to do the work then no app is going to make me do it or do it for me. 

This may sound clichéd but honestly, it is the truth.

I’ve been using a simple todo list on my Notes and Pomodoro timer for more than a year now. I’ve tried Todoist, Asana, Trello, etc. and it all failed. They didn’t make me any better than the simple todo list on my Notes did.

# Produce more by doing less

This is a good reminder for me that the internet is a place where we can get lost easily. It’s human to make mistakes. But sometimes, we have to take a step back and weed out things that do more harm than good. Remember, focus on the process of being productive rather than the app. Maybe a pen and paper are all you need. But if you don’t work for it then a fancy app isn’t going to make you either.
