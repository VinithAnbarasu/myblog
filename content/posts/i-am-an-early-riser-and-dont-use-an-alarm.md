Tbh, I hate alarm. Everybody does. Why?

Alarms are demanding. Nobody likes to answer to demands. So, how do I wake up at 7 AM every day?

I leave my side of the window shades open so that I gradually wake up between 6:45 and 7:15 every morning as the sunlight gets brighter. It is a gentle approach that I’ve come to love.

My friend uses Philips Hue lights and MI Smart bulbs that gradually brighten from 8:00 to 8:30 because the bedroom doesn’t have enough windows to allow the morning light. 

But, waking up is like crossing half the bridge. The other half is, “What are you going to do?”

In remote work, we don’t have to go to the office. So, if we don’t have a reason then being idle can become frustrating and it’s easy to fall into the old habit.

We need reasons.

I have a few consistent daily tasks to shake off the grogginess.

* I take out the garbage. I live on the 7th floor. I use the elevator to go down and climb up the stairs.
* Get vegetables, fruits, and other things ready for breakfast. My wife and I decide our breakfast the previous night and when she wakes up it is all ready to be cooked.
* Finally, I reply to a few emails (personal and work) and make some progress on day-to-day work tasks. 

I make sure to get a few things done for the family and it isn’t all about work. Today I wrote this post as a part of my personal to-do. By the time I’m done with the tasks I am fully active. 

Finally,

* I don’t listen or watch anything immediately after waking up.
* Sometimes, I take a nap (1 hour) after lunch.
* I still use alarms if I have to catch an early flight or travel somewhere as a fail-safe.
* I may sleep through if I had a late-night or were traveling the previous night.
