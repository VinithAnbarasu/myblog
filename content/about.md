## Story of my life

![Profile pic](/dp_trans_wide.png)

I am a UX/Technical Writer now. But years ago I had no idea what I was going to do after graduating Computer Science and Engineering. Tbh, I wasn’t good at coding. I only took Computer Science because I loved video games. I loved it so much I had a site (techbookmark.com) dedicated for gaming where I wrote all about gaming—tips and tricks, downloading and installing games, shortcuts, maps, etc.

The final year came and everyone was busy preparing for campus recruitment. I, on the other hand, with 5.5 CGPA wasn’t eligible for any interviews. Then, Zoho came for Campus Recruitment looking for a Technical Writer with no restrictions. 

I didn’t know what Technical Writer did but it was the only interview I was eligible for so I gave it a try. Only after the first round, I realized I’ve been a Technical Writer all along.

See, the gaming site I had was my portfolio. This gave me confidence. With all those years of gaming and troubleshooting various things, I knew how to get around things and document them which coincidentally was a skill that Technical Writer. 

Finally, after 8 rounds of intense writing and personal interviews, I joined at Zoho.

This was five years ago. I can tell you for sure that being a Technical Writer challenges you and teaches you new things every day and I’m loving every bit of it. For me, my career is like a long-branched tree where the main trunk is Technical Writing.
